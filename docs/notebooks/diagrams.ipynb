    "Sometimes we want to implement a process-valued operator which cannot be expressed in terms of sequential composition.\n",
    "For reasons that will become clear in the next section, we call such operators **bubbles**.\n",
    "The free category with bubbles can be defined by induction over the level of nesting, i.e. an $(n + 1)$-nested bubble is a box which takes an arrow with $n$-nested bubbles as argument.\n",
    "This is implemented by the class `Bubble`, a subclass of `Box` with an attribute `arg: Arrow` and optional arguments `dom` and `cod`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include the exponential of square matrices (used e.g. in the [Schr√∂dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation)) and the element-wise application of a non-linear operator (used e.g. as [activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function) in neural networks).\n",
    "Another example is the gradient of a parameterised matrix, check out the [diagrammatic differentiation](../notebooks/diag-diff.ipynb) notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, bubbles first appeared in the [existential graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_graph#Alpha) of C.S. Peirce, a diagrammatic axiomatisation of first-order logic where bubbles are called **cuts**, they allow to encode **negation**.\n",
    "Formulae are evaluated by applying a functor into the category of finite sets and binary relations, which is equivalent to Boolean matrices.\n",
    "For example, here is an implementation of **system alpha**, a notation for propositional logic where atoms are given by boxes $P : x \\to x$ and conjunction is given by sequential composition."

    "Again, this equivalence relation is defined recursively: if $f \\sim f'$ and $g \\sim g'$ then $(f g) \\sim (f' g')$ and $(f \\otimes g) \\sim (f' \\otimes g')$.\n",
