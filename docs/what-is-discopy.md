DisCoPy is a Python toolkit for computing with string diagrams.
The name stands for *Distributional Compositional Python*, indeed the library was born as an implementation of [DisCoCat](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/DisCoCat): a framework which combines [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and [quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) using [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory).
