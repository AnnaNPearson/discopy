# What is DisCoPy?

DisCoPy is a Python toolkit for computing with string diagrams.

* Theory
  - diagrams (extra: dagger, sums, bubbles)
  - rewriting (interchangers, snakes)
  - functors (e.g. bialgebra in Matrix and Tensor)
  - hierarchy (ref to Selinger's survey)
  - build-your-own (e.g. Lawvere theory)
* Applications
  - formal grammars
  - tensor networks
  - quantum channels
  - quantum optics
  - diag diff
  - QNLP

String diagrams are a formal graphical language for describing **systems** and **processes**.
Concretely, diagrams are built from **boxes** and **wires**.
Each box represents a process with some **input** and **output** wires.
For example:
